# VAGI
## VTech Adventure Game Interpreter

This is a back-port of Sierra Online's Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) to the VTech GL6006SL/7007SL.

It is heavily based on:
* [ScummVM's AGI](https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/tree/master/engines/agi)
* [Brian Provinciano's GBAGI](http://www.bripro.com)
* [davidebyzero's fork of GBAGI](https://github.com/Davidebyzero/GBAGI.git)
